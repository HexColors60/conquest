Steps to create the ico shield texture using a ship texture and gimp.

Oh, what fun that was.

- load ship texture into gimp.

- Colors -> Brightness/Contrast

  lower both to their lowest (-127) and apply.  Your ship is now a dim
  featureless gray blob.

- Select -> By Color

  click on your grey ship so it is selected.

- Filters -> Alpha to Logo -> Alien Glow

  Set the Glow size pixels to 250 (I am using 512x512 textures for the ships)

  Set the glow color to white

- Now your alpha/background is screwed up.  Neat :)

  - in the Layers/Channels/Path window, select the background layer,
    (it should be the one that is all black) and delete it.

  - Image -> Merge visible layers

    select default (expanded as neccessary).  This should not change
    your textures size/resolution.  If it does then try one of the
    other options :)

- Now you've got a glowing black ship.  Next step is to delete the
  ship (hopefully leaving the glow).

  - Select -> By Color

    Check that the main gimp tool window is setup to 'select by
    color'.  de-select 'Select Transparent areas', and set
    the threshhold to something large (I was using 172.0).

    Click in a darker area of the ship.

    The whole ship should be selected, and the 'glow' should be
    unmolested.

- Edit - Cut

This should remove the ship leaving a 'hollow' ship-shaped hole
surrounded by a white, alpha-blended glow.

Save it as a new tga, and try it (modifying texturesrc to reference it
if neccessary).
