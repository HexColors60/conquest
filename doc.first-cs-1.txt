	Ok, here is the latest version of the client/server conquest.
	There have been quite a few changes of course.  The src is in

	l5prime:/home/tx/conquest-7.2c-cs-1.src.tar.gz 

	To build it, I would use something like:

	./configure --prefix=/opt/conqnet --enable-static=no
	make
	
	Then the usual 'make install' as root.

	Run conqoper, init the universe and open the game.  The
	common block has changed (and will probably change a few times
	still before the initial developer release).

	Of course the main change is that there is now a seperate
	conquestd program that listens to network requests from
	clients (conquest).  If you want to run a game on your
	machine, you will need to start conquestd like so:

	/opt/conqnet/bin/conquestd &

	Then if you just type 'conquest', it will try to attach to the
	conquest daemon on your local host.  To connect to a remote
	host, use the '-s' switch.  I have setup a server here that
	you can try to connect to like so:

	/opt/conqnet/bin/conquest -s conquest.radscan.com

	This will take you to the login screen.  Choose a username,
	password etc, login, and kick some ass.

	There is still much work to be done, and not everything works
	yet, though most battle and main menu related commands work.
	Things that don't work:

	- self destruct
	- bombing and beaming
	- tow/untow

	Also, no attempt is yet made to restrict what ship data a
	client recieves, so it would not be too hard to add cheats.
	Obviously this will be implemented before release ;-)  

	Some changes:

	- the 'I' command is no longer provided.  All of those options
          have been added to the User options menu.
	- Users can no longer have multiple ships.  If you have a
          vacant ship, you will be automatically attached to it.
	- many of the Sysconf options have been moved into User
          options (ETA stats, LR torpscan, etc)
        - When using the (U)sers command, only those users attached to
          currently active ships will be listed.
        - Some user options like clear_old_msgs have been removed.
	- the client creates it's logfile in your home directory
          (~/conquest.log).  The conquest daemon, driver, etc still
          use the system log.  Check these for any errors or other
          oddities.
	- There is still alot of debugging messages printed out.  These
          will be removed in a released version.
	- Updates.  From the options menu, you can set the update
          interval anywhere from 1 to 10 updates per second.  2 is the
          default.  There is no AllowFastUpdates capability anymore.
          I would not recommend 10 per second on a modem. Try
          different ones until you find one that works best for your
          connection. 
	- the daemon listens on port 1701 and uses TCP only.  If you
          want to do a public server, you need to allow tcp/1701 into
          your firewall.  I would recomend running the daemon as an
          unprivileged user.

	Here is a list of the remaining major known bugs or other
	issues.  If you find more let me know:

	- need permission/visibility flags for ship updates.  
	- how to handle w0 cloaking. 
	- change cmb to use bitmasks instead of ints for flags, war, etc.
	- bombing/beaming doesn't work
	- tow/untow doesn't work - server side control only I guess...
	- Options - terse on server-side?
	- destruct does not work
	- need to decide on ACK *or* ACKMSG.  No need for both.
	- need to clean up MSG_COMP/COMP2 stuff - too hacky.  MSG flags?
	- need to look into disp error, when entering and you already have
	  another ship flying (doesn't give you the correct screen/msg)
        - in conquest userlist, ships are all listed as type ROBOT
	- protocol is not endian-safe yet.
	- clients shouldn't try to do any locking
	- recording kinda works.  


	Let me know when you guys want to try it out ;-)
