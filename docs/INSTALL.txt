### REQUIREMENTS

    Hopefully Conquest's requirements aren't too arduous.

    At a minimum:

    - a C++ compiler conforming to c++11 like g++ 4.9 or greater and
      clang 3.4 or greater.

    - bison and flex

    - a decent curses implementation

    - automake/autoconf/autoreconf/autoincludes/libtool.  You will
      need the complete autotools packages installed.

    For building the client 'conquest', you will need:

    - X11 (or xorg) libraries and header files (all of them :)

    - OpenGL libraries and header files.

    - freeglut libraries and header files.

    For sound support you will need:

    - SDL 1.2 libraries and header files ( http://www.libsdl.org/ ),
      with OGG Vorbis support (pretty much standard I think).

    - SDL_mixer v1.2 library and header files (
      http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/ ).


### QUICKSTART GUIDE

    So you are impatient and want to build and play.  Here's a short
    list to get you going.  Read the later sections for more details.

    - unpack and build the sources.

      $ sudo groupadd conquest  # only needs to be done the first time
      $ sh ./autogen
      $ ./configure
      $ make
      $ sudo make install

    - to play on a remote server

        $ conquest

      You will be presented to a list of available servers.  Pick one
      and go!

    - to go directly to a specific server (conquest.radscan.comm, port
      1701 in this case):

        $ conquest -s conquest.radscan.com:1701

      The port is optional and defaults to 1701.
