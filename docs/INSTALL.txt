### REQUIREMENTS

    Hopefully Conquest's requirements aren't too arduous.

    At a minimum:

    - a C compiler.  GCC is the one I use, though I try not to
      introduce gcc-isms.

    - bison or yacc.

    - flex or lex

    - a decent curses implementation

    - automake/autoconf/autoreconf/autoincludes/libtool.  You will
      need the complete autotools packages installed.

    For building the client 'conquest', you will need:

    - X11 (or xorg) libraries and header files (all of them :)

    - OpenGL libraries and header files.

    - glut or freeglut libraries and header files.

    For sound support you will need:

    - SDL libraries and header files ( http://www.libsdl.org/ ), with
      OGG Vorbis support (pretty much standard I think).

    - SDL_mixer library and header files
      ( http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/ ).


### QUICKSTART GUIDE

    So you are impatient and want to build and play.  Here's a short
    list to get you going.  Read the later sections for more details.

    - unpack and build the sources. (If you are using Cygwin under MS
      Windows, see README.cygwin for further information and ignore
      the 'groupadd' commands listed below.)

      $ sudo groupadd conquest
      $ tar xzvf conquest-x.y.src.tar.gz
      $ cd conquest-x.y
      $ sh ./autogen
      $ ./configure
      $ make
      $ sudo make install

    - to play on your own local server

      - Init everything

        $ sudo conqoper -C
        $ sudo conqoper -Ie -E

        $ sudo conqoper

          - this runs conqoper in interactive mode.  Go into the
            Options menu and set any flags you want enabled for your
            server.

      - startup a server

        $ conquestd -d

      - play

        $ conquest

    - to play on a remote server

      - using the meta server to list available servers, and allow you
        to select one to play on:

        $ conquest -m

      - to go directly to a specific server (conquest.radscan.com in
        this case):

        $ conquest -s conquest.radscan.com


### DISTRIBUTION

    conquest-x.y.src.tar.gz       - gziped tar archive of the source
                                    distribution.

    Unzip/untar this in a nice, quiet, peaceful place.  I use:

       $ tar xzvf conquest-x.y.src.tar.gz

    The README file provides useful information about conquest, please
    look it over.


### BUILDING

    To build conquest, unpack the src archive.

    Create the 'conquest' group.  In Linux this can be done with
    (as root) 'groupadd conquest'.  Don't bother doing this on Cygwin
    systems.  See README.cygwin for further info on these systems.

    NOTE: You *must* create a conquest group, or '[make |make install]'
    will fail.

    Then cd into the src directory.

    Conquest makes use of the GNU Autoconf system for maintaining
    source code able to compile on many different machines.

	Theoretically, all you will need to do is:

	$ sh ./autogen
	$ ./configure
	$ make

	(note: you will not be able to execute many of the binaries
               until you do a make install, then run the installed
               binary)
	$ sudo make install

    Options to configure:

    --prefix=

      By default, conquest will be installed in /opt.  To install it
      somewhere else, supply the '--prefix=/other/dir' option to
      configure.

    --disable-gl

      If you do not want to build the GLUT/OpenGL bits, pass
      '--disable-gl' the the configure cmdline.

    --disable-sound

      If you do not want to build sound support pass
      '--disable-sound' the the configure cmdline.

    You may also want to peek at the defs.h file, though the defaults
    should be fine.  If your porting this to something else, good
    luck...But if you do succeed in a port to a new platform, please
    let me know so I can incorporate it into the distribution.  The
    autoconf source file 'configure.ac' is supplied for this purpose
    ;-)

    As root, intialize the system-wide conquestrc file
    (/opt/conquest/etc/conquestrc by default) by typing:

	/opt/bin/conqoper -C

    'make install' will do this for you, but if you want to be sure...

    Then, you will want to Initialize the universe and enable the
    game.  You can do this from the main menu in conqoper, or
    non-interactively from the command line like so:

        conqoper -Ie -E

        - this Initializes everything, then Enables the game.

    Next, you may want to enter the Options menu and configure the
    options you want enabled for your game.

    You should now be ready to run the server and try it out.

    See the README file for more information.

    See the SERVER.DOC file for information on running a Conquest
    server.

    Read the conquest.doc and the HISTORY files to get info on
    what conquest is and how to play it.


# Under MAC OSX (Darwin)

  Building under MAC OSX is similiar to the standard unix method
  described above, however, you will likely need to get (or build)
  SDL and SDL_mixer with OGG Vorbis support.  GLUT seems to be included
  by default.

# Under Windows with MinGW

  For a Windows build, I use a MinGW cross-compiler environment under
  Linux - I have not tried to actually build it under windows itself
  using MSYS/MinGW.  In theory, it should work just fine as long as
  you have the prequisite environment setup, including the development
  packages for SDL, SDL_mixer, libz, and GLUT.

  See the MINGW_BUILD.sh file that I use to compile it on my linux
  system - you would most likely need to tweak it for your own
  environment.

  Mote, a Windows build only compiles the code neccessary to build the
  client (conquest).  None of the other binaries are
  compiled.

  If you want to run your own conquest server, or other conquest
  binaries and utilities, you will either need to compile and run them
  under the Cygwin environment, or under a unix/linux host or VM.

  I would not advise attempting to use the OpenGL client (conquest)
  under Cygwin as there will be no hardware acceleration, and you
  would need to run the xorg X server.

  See README.cygwin for information on compiling/using conquest under
  the cygwin environment.
