DISTRIBUTION

	You should have recieved one (or both) of the following files:
	(where x.y is the current revision)

	conquest-x.y.pkg.gz	- gziped Unixware binary package (in 
                                  stream format) for use with pkgadd(1).

		Use the following commands to unpack and install on
		Unixware:

		$ gunzip conquest-x.y.pkg.tar.gz
                $ tar xvf conquest-x.y.pkg.tar
		(as root)
		# pkgadd -d /full/path/to/conquest-x.y.pkg


	conquest-x.y.src.tar.gz	- gziped tar archive of the source
                                  distribution.

		Unzip/untar this in a nice, quiet, peaceful place.  I
                use 'gzcat conquest-x.y.src.tar.gz |tar -xvf -'.

		cd into the the source directory and type
'./configure'.  Configure will try to determine some characteristics
about your system and build a Makefile and config.h for you.  The
default is to install Conquest into /opt.  You can use the '--prefix='
option to confiure a different location, as in './configure
--prefix=/usr/local'.


	Currently, only the following OS's have been tried:

		Unixware 2.03 (1.x/2.x should be fine too)
		Linux 2.0.0, with ncurses-1.9.9e (old ncurses *may* work)
		FreeBSD 2.2-100696-SNAP (stock curses works, but
			without color apparently...)


	ncurses-1.9.9e is certain to work on both fbsd and Linux.  If
the curses implementation on your machine has problems, you might try
ncurses... It's free and doess a reasonable job at emulating svr4
curses.  

	TERMINAL NOTE: Conquest depends on a properly configured
terminfo entry for your terminal in order to make use of Fkey's, the
arrow keys, the keypad, and color.  The standard at386 terminfo entry
on Unixware for example, does not define the SHIFT-Fkeys, nor the
keypad (upperright, lowerleft, etc).  Some modification to your
terminfo entry may be required to use these extended features.


BUILDING

	To build conquest, unpack the src archive.  

	Create the 'conquest' group.  In Unixware this can be done
with (as root) 'groupadd conquest'.

	NOTE:  You *must* create a conquest group, or 'make install
will fail!

	Then cd into the src directory.

	Conquest now makes use of the GNU Autoconf system for
maintaining source code able to compile on many different machines.

	Theoretically ;-) all you will need to do is:

	$ ./configure
	$ make depend (or make clean if you lack makedepend)
	$ make all
	(note: you will not be able to execute any of the binaries
               until you do a make install, then run the installed
               binary)
	$ su
	# make install

	By default, conquest will be installed in /opt.  To install it
somewhere else, supply the '--prefix=/other/dir' option to configure.

	You may also want to peek at the defs.h file, though the
defaults should be fine.  If your porting this to something else, good
luck...But if you do succeed in a port to a new platform, please let
me know so I can incorporate it into the distribution.  The autoconf
src file 'configure.in' is supplied for this purpose ;-)

	As root, intialize the system-wide conquestrc file
(/opt/conquest/etc/conquestrc by default) by typing:

	/opt/bin/conqoper -C

	Edit /opt/conquest/etc/conquestrc and see if everything there
is ok for your site.

	Then run the conqoper program and (i)nitialize->(e)verything,
open the game, and you should now be ready to rock-n-roll.

	See the README file for more information.

	Read the conquest.doc and the conqnews.doc files to get info
on what conquest is and how to play it.
