                              Conquest News

Version 7.0.1  Fri Sep  3 18:20:52 MST 1999 Jon Trulson  <jon@radscan.com>

        - This is a maintenance release, fixing some minor bugs and
          a major one for RH6.0 (uhg), as well as a new port.

        - Conquest now runs on on Digital Unix V4.0 (OSF1).  Thanks to
          an old Conquest junkie, Jim Anderson (janderson@NOVALIS.COM)
          for this port.  Thanks Jim!

          DU has the same lex problem that Solaris has... See the 
          SOLARIS/DU NOTES section in the INSTALL file for a hacky 
          workaround.  If anyone has the magic syntax to achieve the
          same effect, but work on all systems, please let me know... 
          It's annoying.

        - configure.in modified so that the options used on an UNKNOWN
          system type are more likly to succeed (it no longer assumes a 
          UnixWare system).

        - one fix to options.c, the ESC cancel wasn't working right

	- a cast problem picked up by Jim Anderson while doing the OSF/DU
          port

        - and of course, the addition of the -D__NO_MATH_INLINES CFLAG
          required on RH6.0 systems to work around a bug that
          caused strange conqdriv failures.


Version 7.0    Thu Jan 28 21:14:41 MST 1999 Jon Trulson  <jon@radscan.com>

        - Remote User support, which should make things much nicer for
          operators and internet players.  A 'remote' player's usernames
          are always prefixed with an '@' character in all output that
          shows usernames.  See the file SERVER.DOC for information on
          how to setup and run a conquest server.

        - A new (O)ptions menu is now available at the Conquest main
          menu, as well as while playing the game.  This menu allows
          users to view the options compiled into Conquest, view the
          system-wide options set by the Conquest operator, View/Edit
          the users ~/.conquestrc options, View/Edit macros, and for
          remote users: change your password.  Operators can change a
          remote user's password in the (e)dit User option in
          conqoper.  The conqoper program now lets operators View/Edit
          the system-wide configurables... Per-item help text for each
          option is also available.  You should never need to manually
          edit the conquestrc files again ;-)

        - conoper now understands some command line options.  Try
          'conqoper -?' to see which ones.  These make it rather
          trivial to reset the game on a regular basis from crontab for
          example.

	- common block data has been completely restructured.
          Actually, it is structured *now*, as opposed to the 70 or so
          parallel arrays that used to be there ;-)  The code is much
          easier to read and maintain, and several bugs were
          identified and fixed as a result.

        - new sys-wide options:
           allow_switchteams - whether new users are allowed to 
                               switch teams at the main menu
           user_expiredays   - number of days of inactivity for a
                               user before s/he is expired.

        - approximate elapsed time (accurate to 1 minute) per player
          is displayed for each entry in (H)istory now.

        - the ETA algorithm used for ship-to-ship (only) scans has
          been re-worked somewhat.  Now ship/ship ETA's are calculated
          using an average closure rate.  This mean you need to scan a
          ship at least twice in a row to get reasonable ETA's.  A
          single scan will assume that both ships are heading directly
          at each other, as no closure rate information is available.
          It will also list the ETA as 'never' if there's no hope
          you'll ever intercept the target ship.

        - keypad keys are translated into direction keys - now you can
          aim, and set course using the keypad the same way the
          direction keys are used.

        - new common block of 256KB - room for 500 users. (ha!)

        - standardized 'more' and 'done' prompts.

        - renamed at386 terminfo entry to at386-uwcq to avoid conflict
          with linux's at386 entry.  This entry is used by UnixWare
          users that play from the console.

	## Now for the bug fixes ##

        - fixed neg array reference in messaging code.

        - fixed neg array ref and write in conqoper that corrupted the
          message ring, user block, and anything else laying around.
          But only on Tuesdays.

        - fixed negative Users[] array ref in conqoper sighandler.

        - fixed off by one in takeplanet() that allowed you to conquer
          the universe without taking RigelB.

        - fixed conqoper to not send entry msg when COMMONBLOCK is
          invalid.  (can you say segv?)

        - fixed invisible user bug (resign, then re-enter).  Now
          Conquest exits when you resign.

        - fixed evil self destruct bug that caused two killship()
          calls to be executed when a user was killed while in the
          process of self destructing.

        - added extra checks for linux glibc problem, where for some
          reason fd_set is declared as a typedef rather than a
          struct. Wierd.

        - elapsed time bugs fixed.  Again.  'VACANT' ships no longer
          add to the elapsed/cpu times for teams and users.

        - (U)ser Statistics, and (S) More User Statistics screens now
          track arriving/departing users in real-time.

        - fixed locking bug in initeverything().

        - bug in listplan() ((?) Planet List) that corrupted page
          header fixed.

        - many bugs and oddities with cdgetp() (line based input
          routine) fixed.  Perhaps I should give the 'readline'
          library a try??

        - the lastentry time for a user is now updated whenever a user
          enters a ship, not just when the ship is first initialized.

        - isagod() checks are more stringent and reliable.

        - clog buffer increased.  Large logging events don't cause a
          segv anymore.

        - fixed bug in astservice relating to message display timing
          for those with 25 line screens.  Those without 25 lines (on
          which messages are displayed on the 23rd line), shouldn't
          miss messages anymore when entering a command at the same
          time a message is being displayed.  Those with 25 line
          terminals will get messages asyncronously on the 25th line,
          regardless of whether you're issuing other commands at the
          time or not. 

        - fixed bug where switching teams and then dying in a
          reincarnated ship would 'do the wrong' thing regarding
          ship's team selection when you re-entered the game.  This
          rather esoteric bug was found by Dave Payne.  Of course. ;-)

        - conqoper watch(): doomsday 'type' member and display code
          removed - useless.  The doomsday's status is now displayed
          symbolically in the doomsday watch() screen.

        - DCL subshell code finally excorsized.  Don't need it, don't
          want it. ;-)

        - all debug related logging turned off.

        - on planet list, number of armies is displayed in same color
          as planet now.


Version 6.6    Thu Dec 24 16:03:31 1997  Jon Trulson  <jon@radscan.com>

        - added 20 new 'extra' play planets for use by enterprising
          universe developers.  The various planet listers modified 
          to support more than one page of planets.

        - switched to the use of 'double' as the floating point type
          instead of 'float'

        - new common block due to the float -> double change, and the
          new play planets.

        - full coloring of LR/SR displays.  The color scheme used is
          alert based.. ie: dangerous things (like enemy ships or 
          planets) are red, team things are green etc.

	- all other text in the game (and conqoper) was colored by 
          David Payne <davep@radscan.com> using a new cprintf()
          function that can handle embedded attribute codes.

        - color in conqoper is different, as an operator doesn't
          (supposedly) take sides.  The goal in conqoper was to use 
          coloring for enhancement only (except when watching a ship).

        - exploding ships. Ouch.  Implemented by 'faking' a special
          type of torp launch.  

        - the messages sent regarding entering/dying in conquest
          now use per ship information, rather than per user 
          information.  This make things consistent, and also
          works properly for users with multiple ships.

        - watch display in conqoper is now interupt driven, like 
          conquest.

        - watch display in conqoper modified to use '<>' or arrow
          keys to switch from ship to ship.  Dave Payne provided
          this patch.

        - debug doomsday screen removed, watch display in conqoper
          now lets you watch from the doomsday's perspective.
          Patch by Dave Payne.

        - most frequently used commands (like (r)obot, (k)ill,
          (/)player list, etc) are available from watch in 
          conqoper.  Patch by Dave Payne.

	- (e)dit user in conqoper now removes the '+' current 
          field indicator as you move around between the various
          options.

        - destroying a warlike ship, no longer causes 'invisible'
          sticky war with that team if you weren't officially at war 
          with that team when you killed it (but it was at war with you).

        - beaming armies down to a self-ruled planet without bombing
          it, no longer works.  You could take planets this way without 
          suffering any damage, but it would take a long time, and alot
          of armies.  Now when you beam armies down to a self-ruled 
          planet, it is considered an act of war, just like bombing is.

        - playlist now lists the PID of the controlling ship, or
          "VACANT" if the ship has no controlling process, or "ROBOT" 
          if the ship is a robot.

        - you can type long messages now.  While typing a mesage, when 
          you reach the end of the line, what you've typed is sent, 
          followed by a '-', and then you are prompted for more text.  
          Much easier to type long messages.  Thanks to Dave Payne
          for this patch.

        - Conquest has been ported to Solaris 2.6 using gcc 2.7.2.1

        - the display will now operate properly when changing your
          name while flying. Yes. I got killed by changing my name, 
          and forgetting no screen updates were taking place. I had 
          24 kills too. ;-)

        - a bug in the driver that caused ship headings to briefly 
          go negative or invalid during a slow turn has been fixed.

        - a bug in towing that miscalculated relative velocities between
          two ships has been fixed.  This bug was in the original RATFOR 
          code.

        - fixed bug in untow that caused incorrect warp factors to be
          set for the towed ship when it was untractored, and the 
          tower was in orbit.  Can you say "hyperdimensional 
          shifting"?   This bug was in the original RATFOR code.

        - the handling of multiple ships, and entering while already
          playing are much improved.  Now you get the option of 
          re-incarnating to other ships (if you are allowed multiple 
          ships), and/or creating a new one. Players who are not 
          allowed multiple ships will no longer be blown out of the 
          game if the same user tries to enter conquest (from another
          terminal for instance).

        - lots of lint based cleanup... found and fixed several 
          'minor' bugs that way.  *Lots* of unused variables and code 
          removed.

        - gamlb module removed - no longer needed

        - most translation (Ratfor to C) macros removed.

        - combined ioxlb.c, ionlb.c, and ioplb.c into one module:
          iolb.c

        - removed conqfig.c module - relevant defs are in defs.h

        - Reviewing messages lets you scroll back and forth using
          the arrow keys.

        - display code moved into new display.c module

        - several rounding problems related to using abs() when should
          have been using fabs() fixed.

        - bug fixed in buildai() that scaled fuel incorrectly causing 
          robots to do dumb things when fuel was low (they always 
          thought they had plenty of fuel).  This fix has resulted 
          in smarter robots.  Two rules in conqrule had to be modified 
          to cover up a logic 'hole' that became apparent when this bug 
          was fixed.  This bug was in the original RATFOR code.

        - some terminfo entries that work good with conquest are now
          supplied with the source distribution.

        - a new 'realclean' target is provided in the Makefile.  This
          target is the same as a 'make clean', but additionally 
          removes files generated by configure.  You will need to 
          re-run configure after a 'make realclean'.

        - some commenting spiffed up.




Version 6.4    Fri Mar 28 15:09:02 1997  Jon Trulson  <jon@radscan.com>

        - changed phaser graphics to stop when it hits a ship.  Can be
          handy when 'probing' for a cloaked ship, when you're also
          cloaked.

        - docloak() fixed so that engine overload is checked, not weapons
          overload in determining whether you can cloak.

        - if you destroy another ship, you're automatically at sticky war 
          with that team.

        - now when you fire torps, phasers are aimed as well.

        - fixed safectoi() bugs. finally.  ctoi() and ctor() modified
          accordingly.

        - fixed misspelling in conqstrat so that ROB_SILENT is a valid
          action.

        - fixed bugs in targeting.  Invalid targets are now reported as
          such.

        - configure.in modified so that libl.a/libfl.a (flex/lex) libs 
          are looked for if the other can't be found.  


        
Version 6.3    Tue Dec 24 16:59:20 1996  Jon Trulson  <jon@radscan.com>

        - the conqstrat rule parser is now operational!  Now you can rebuild
          or modify the robot strategy tables.  The current strategy
          table used by the robots as shipped is defined in conqdata.h.
          This file was generated by conqstrat using the conqrule file, 
          which defines the robot's actions under certain conditions.
          I've already added one rule that should lessen accidental
          robot sun-deaths.  No more than 32 rules can be defined.
          I'm willing to incorporate other 'amusing' robot strategy
          definitions into the Conquest distribution if mailed to me.  
          Enjoy ;-)

        - fixed bugs in special() causing certain lookups to return
          inaccurate or invalid responses, like 'iwp'.

        - added allow_sigquit in sys-wide conquestrc file.  If true
          then all players can exit immediately using SIGQUIT (normally
          ^\).

        - moved player death notification msg code to killship() from 
          dead().  Now you get a message when a robot dies too.

	- fixed nasty variable collision bug with uname under newer
          Linux's... This caused a SEGV when uname[][] was mapped into 
          the common block.  I wonder why :-)

	- added extra check to cdinit() to ensure the bkgset() function
          isn't used with ncurses.



Version 6.0     Sat Nov 30 22:50:25 1996  Jon Trulson  <jon@radscan.com>

        - Conquest now uses GNU's autoconf facility for portability.

        - This version has been compiled on FreeBSD 2.2 100696-SNAP.

        - increased MAX_MACROS from 12 to 24.  Now SHIFT F1-12 can
          be defined as well.  Your terminfo entry must be configured
          properly to take advantage of any of the Fkeys and the 
          keypad.

	- The common block was modified to support 'phantom' kills for
          robots.  To enable this, define do_random_robotkills=true
          in the system-wide conquestrc file.  If defined, robots
          will be created with a random kills value, possibly making 
          them stronger, but without screwing up the statistics.  Makes
          them a little tougher and unpredictable.  Probably not for new
          players though ;-)

        - made some curses calls more efficient.

        - robots now use 30/70 power allocations instead of the old 40/60.

        - lots of fixes to the semaphore code to support linux and 
          FreeBSD.  Modified semaphore stats line in conqoper to 
          provide more information.

        - c_sleep() behaves itself better under linux/fbsd

        - ibuf.c: - moved ibuf related vars from global.h to a new ibuf.h 
          where they belong.

	- added capability to use 25th line on display (if you have it)
          to display messages.  Much nicer.  On some terminals you may
          need to set LINES=25 and export it in your shell before
          firing up conquest.  If you have color, messages will be
          displayed in cyan.

        - fixed rounding bugs in safectoi() and oneplace()

        - ^L (refresh) handling is much faster, and turns off
          the display interrupt before refreshing to prevent screen
          corruption.

        - if you don't have 25 lines, you will no longer get messages
          while reviewing old ones, causing strangness. 

        - sighandler modified.  CO's need to use QUIT (^\) to exit 
          (without self-destructing) instead of INTR.

        - removed syscall RESTART dependancies. Too unreliable.

        - added support for fastupdate option (see ~/.conquestrc and
          the system-wide conquestrc file).  This means that on systems
          that support setitimer(), you can get 2 updates per sec, 
          rather than one.  You get no advantage over another player if
          your doing 2 updates per sec, and the other player is only
          doing one, it just makes things seem a little smoother.

        - conqoper modified to support the -C (create new sys-wide 
          conquestrc file) option.  If the system-wide conquestrc
          file is determined to be out of date, conquest and conqoper
          will warn you when starting up, and use internal defaults for
          any new options, until it's updated by 'conqoper -C'.

        - mods to player edit so that arrow keys/keypad can be used for 
          navigating around the screen in conqoper.

        - many more formatting bugs fixed in conqoper.

        - modified planetlist screen to mark 'core' planets (planets
          you have to take to conquer the universe) with a preceeding
          '+' sign.

        - replaced bogus PLANET_SHITFACE with PLANET_ALTAIR, a new,
          non-core planet, yet *quite* valuable strategically. ;-)  
          Since it's creation, many fierce battles have been fought 
          over Altair. heh

        - tweaked shield alert displays during a red/yellow alert to be more
          consistent.

        - removed blink attr for anything other than a red alert status 
          with your shields down.
 
        - tweaked secdriv() to multiply the cooldown factors of weap and
          engines by PLANET_REPAIR_FAC if orbiting a friendly populated 
          planet.  This means you cool down faster in orbit about a 
          friendly planet.

        - made an adjustment to PHASER_HIT to compensate for the new 70/30
          energy split.  Rom's had too much adv at close range.  They could
          kill you with 2-3 phaser hits, even with shields up.  Romulan 
          phasers are still quite deadly up close.
 
        - tweaked COMMONSTAMP (new common block), DOUBLE_E_KILLS (to 40.0),
          MIN_COUP_MINUTES (not as long), MIN_UNINHAB_MINUTES (not as long).

        - configuration code mostly rewritten to make more maintainable.

        - modified cdinit() to not use bkgdset(...) if running under 
          ncurses.  It has a bug that corrupts the colors if a backgroud 
          is set, but not at color pair 0 (which under SVID is illegal). 
          Bummer.  if using ncurses, you might prefer a black background, 
          so if running under an xterm, set your background to black.

        - fixed oppedit so that (T)eam ownership works, and in the
          right circumstances.

        - changed newrob() to disable OPT_ALERTBELL so that conqoper
          won't beep when watch()'ing a robot.

        - conqutil.c: - fixed ownership problems when the log file is
          created.

        - do_fastupdate and do_limitbell options added to ~/.conquestrc

        - players, by default, can now switch teams at the main menu in 
          conquest.  

	- many other small fixes.



Version 5.8	Thu Jul 11 11:24:38 1996  Jon Trulson  <jon@radscan.com>

        - this version now runs on Linux.  This port was done by
          David Payne <davep@radscan.com>.  Here are the requirements:

          GCC 2.7.2
          libc.so.5.2.18
          ncurses-1.9.9e
          kernel 1.99.14 (pre-2.0.14)

          see the README.linux file (in the src dist) for more 
          information.

        - a new option, rcv_player_msgs has been added to ~/.conquestrc.
          See ~/.conquestrc for more info on this option.

        - lots of code cleanup in all modules.  Dead functions
          removed.

        - conqoper's debugdisplay now shows torp status for a ship
          symbolically.

        - all planet lists in conqoper and conquest are now sorted
          alphabetically.  Additionally, all user lists are now sorted
          by skill level.

        - torpedo launch() code made more efficient in it's use of
          semaphore operations.  The number of semaphore operations
          required to launch a spread (3) has been reduced by 2/3
          from 12 semops per spread, to 4.  This should improve
          'hairy' battle performance noticably (on a 486 anyway).

        - Made message beeping for conqoper #definable - see defs.h.  
          By default it's off.  When there's alot of message traffic, 
          it can beep continously.  How annoying.

        - changed logic in conqoper's planet list to eliminate 1
          second delay when entering that mode.

        - changed planet HELL from Empire armies to Self Ruled
          armies.  There is no Empire team at this time.

        - randomized 'virtual armies' for suns.  Used to determine
          the damage a ship takes when passing near/over one.

        - Suns are now immune from Malthusian Crisises.  This problem 
          sometimes resulted in *weak* suns.

        - Jinx is no longer created with 512 armies. Ooops. ;-)

        - fixed macro expansion bug that sometimes caused a Malthusian
          crisis to set a planet's population to 0.  This made for
          easy pickings.

        - Conquest no longer requires the 'conquest' user account.  
          The 'conquest' group will always be required (unless you
          run an 'insecure' game (planned for the future - see TODO)). 

        - added check to conquest/conqoper that requires your terminal 
          to have at least 80 cols, and 24 lines.



Version 5.7	Sat May 25 01:01:17 1996  Jon Trulson  <jon@radscan.com>

        - this version now supports a system-wide configuration file.
          Available options are:

          do_lr_torpscan - can see friendly torps on an LR scan?
          do_local_lrscan - LR (M)ap is ship centered or Murisak
                            centered?
          do_etastats - show ETA's on (I)nfo commands?
          no_doomsday - disable the doomsday machine?

          see /opt/conquest/etc/conquestrc for further information.

        - improved robustness of semaphore code.  You can now 
          conquer the universe without killing the game and your
          login session.

        - improved signal handling.  You can't susp out anymore
          and SIGQUIT/SIGTERM are enabled for conquest gods only.

        - conquest now determines whether a user is a conquest
          god by checking to see if they are a member of the 
          conquest group in /etc/group.  The root user is always
          a conquest god.  Being a conquest god means you can run
          the conqoper program.

        - fixed bug that made cpu usage stats totally bogus dude.  
          They should now be reasonably accurate.

        - fixed bug in the beaming code that caused extra beeping
          if you were beaming armies down to a hostile planet, and
          you were also within red-alert range of an enemy ship.

        - off-by-one error in robot defend() routine fixed.  Now
          Romulans have defenders.

        - robots are no longer created with random kills.  It 
          screwed up the statistics too much.

        - changed locking info bar in conqoper to display some
          semaphore statistics.




Version 5.6	Thu May  2 02:55:15 1996  Jon Trulson  <jon@radscan.com>

        - implemented the pagefile() function, so now there is documentation
          available from within conquest.  Try the (n)ews and (h)elp lesson
          from the conquest welcome screen.  NOTE: If your reading this,
	  then you have already tried the (n)ews option ;-)

        - this version of conquest now supports semaphores to syncronize
          writes to the conquest common block.  No longer should you be
          subject to random SEGV's due to 2 conquest's trying to aquire
          the same lock.  Yes!  Note: this is still undergoing testing.

        - the TAB key can now be used to ask for your 'next' last info. ie:
          it is equivalent to typeing 'i<TAB>'.  This matches the command
          change I made awhile back where RETURN is equivalent to 'i<RETURN>'

	- added code (enabled by defining DO_LR_TORPSCAN in defs.h)
	  that allows you to see your torps, and friendly torps
	  on a long range scan.  This option may may moved to the 
	  system configuration file when that capability is added in the
	  future.

	- added code to conqoper that will let the operator monitor
	  semaphore usage on the main screen.  Unfortunately, I can't 
	  seem to figure out how to get certain information, like the
	  PID of the last process to alter the semaphore(s).  Right
	  now all this info will tell you is: The status of the 
	  semaphores (LOCKED ("*") or UNLOCKED ("")), the number of
	  semaphore operations (since the last Universe INIT), and
	  the date/time of the last operation.

	- several more small fixes, and some dead code removed.



Version 5.5	Sun Apr 28 18:04:51 1996  Jon Trulson  <jon@radscan.com>

	- A user-customizable configuration file, ~/.conquestrc, is
	  now available!
	  The ~/.conquestrc file is now automatically created in the users
	  home directory if the file does not exist, or is out-of-date.
	  This file allows users to customize certain playing attributes
	  for conquest, as well as providing the only method whereby the 
	  FKey macros (F1-12) can be defined.  See your ~/.conquestrc 
	  file for information on the options available.
	  If your ~/.conquestrc file is out-of-date, a new one will be
	  created and your current settings (those that are still 
	  applicable with the new version) will be preserved in it.  
	  Note: Any comments (beginning with '#') that you add to the
	  file WILL NOT be preserved if conquest decides to update your 
	  ~/.conquestrc file.

	- fixed bug in dead() that sometimes prevented one from knowing
	  exactly how one died.  Kind of anti-climactic don't you think?

	- fixed torp formatting bug in conqoper's debugdisplay()

	- fixed lower() and upper() so that the strings are actually operated
	  on properly.  Due to a bug I introduced, they actually had no
	  effect.  Sorry.

	- added ENABLE_MACROS to defs.h to enable the ibuf.c module.  needed
	  to support macros (defined in your ~/.conquestrc file).  
	  This option may be added to the system wide conquest config 
	  file when that capability becomes available.

	- added DO_LOCAL_LRSCAN to defs.h to determine whether (M)ap 
	  has it's original meaning (a fixed map of the universe with 
          Murisak at the center), or is more real by acting like a Long 
	  Range scan (a dynamic map with your ship at the center).
	  This option may be added to the system wide conquest config 
	  file when that capability becomes available.

	- conquest versioning is now handled by the version.c module
	  instead of hardcoded VERSION_NUMBER and VERSION_DATE macros. 

	- switched experimental weapons alloc range back to 30/70 from 
	  10/90. 10/90 was way too deadly when the romulans were firing 
	  at you (close range) with 90% weapons allocation!

	- modified dobeam() so that you could take any planet with 0
	  armies, even if you weren't at war with the team that 'owned' the
	  planet - applies to home system planets only.

	- modified astservice() to make sure a msg was actually delivered
	  before beep'ing at the user.

	- added conf_MessageBell check to astservice(). If TRUE, you get
	  a beep whenever you receive a message.  See ~/.conquestrc

	- fixed some formatting problems in conqoper's debugging watch()

	- fixed the orbital velocity of Syrinx.  It was way too slow.

	- added conf_NoRobotMsgs check to readmsg().  If TRUE you won't
	  get msgs back from friendly robots. See ~/.conquestrc

	- fixed many small formatting errors in status reports like
	  team stats and user stats pages.

	- secdrive() modified so that fuel usage depends on *actual* warp,
	  and NOT on your *desired* warp.

	- adjusted DOUBLE_E_KILLS up to 35.0 from 25.0.  This means you 
	  will need 35.0 kills to double your efficiency.  It may move
	  upwards again depending...
	  
	- fixed a bad clog() call

	- removed dead/obsolete code, more of that to come I'm sure...




Version 5.4	Mon Apr  1 01:59:17 1996  Jon Trulson  <jon@radscan.com>

	- first semi-production version.  It's been about 3 years
	  since I started this port.  And what phun it's been! ;-)

	- ibuf.c - an initial run at an FKey macro capability.

	- rewrote iochav() using poll() and getmsg().  Seems to work...

	- removed ALT_IOCHAV #define - no such animal anymore. eventually, all
	  ALT_* #defines will go away.

	- eliminated dependancies on the conquest UID and conquest
	  GID.  These are now determined at run-time.  Eventually,
	  conquest will no longer require it's own user in order to run.
	  To prevent cheating however, a conquest group will always be 
	  required.

	- added DEBUG_LOCKING and DEBUG_MACROS debugging capability.

	- turned off DEBUG_SIG and DEBUG_IO. they seem to be okay for now...

	- re-did arrows() function *again* using original alg, and a 
	  fixed mod360().

	- fixed mod360() to (properly) use fmodf() instead of mod().  Now it
	  works without rounding errors caused by using the integer version
	  of mod() ;-)

	- modified command() to allow '*' to = 'd' - det torps, and
	  '[RETURN]' to equal 'i\r' - get last info.  modified dohelp()
	  accordingly.

	- added priority code to conqinit, so conquest will run at 
	  CONQUEST_PRI, and conqdriv will run at CONQDRIV_PRI.
	  It makes the game much more 'snappy' and doesn't appear to affect
	  system performance.  This requires the TSHAR privilege 
	  (Unixware 1.x, 2.x, SVR4.2).  If the appropriate privilege
	  is unavailable, a complaint will be written to the 
	  conquest.log file, though the game will still run.  On systems
	  that don't support the privilege mechanism, your currently
	  SOL.  Conquest was not designed to run SUID root (which
	  would be required), and I don't think any game has a 
	  right to be.  Eventually, (if there's enough demand) the 
	  relevant portions of code could be SUID safe.  I just
	  prefer the privilege mechanism, as it's more specific as to
	  the kind of privileges I need, and more secure.

	- changed sendmsg() to allow a [RETURN] to act like [TAB], ie:
	  send message to last person I sent a msg to.

	- modified display() to blink-red the shields indicator if they are
	  down, and you're at yellow or red alert.  Monochrome screens now 
	  use A_REVERSE | A_BOLD for red, instead of A_BLINK | A_BOLD.


	- tweaked cloak code a wee bit to make it more usable, though 
	  not *too* usable ;-)

	- modified CLOAK_SMEAR_DIST to 800 from 500 to make it a little more
	  vague when scanning for a cloaked ship.



Version 5.3(-)	Sat Mar 16 22:11:20 1996  Jon Trulson  <jon@radscan.com>


	This section describes versions at or below Version 5.3.  This
was the version that was actually running well enough to play some
decent games with a couple of friends with minimal bugs and crashing.
This was about 1 year after I had progressed with the port far enough
to have the major components working (semi) correctly, as well as the
fortran common block implementation operational. I could actually
fly a ship. Wow.

	- added extra check to PVLOCK() to make sure we *actually* got the 
	  lock.
	  I swear.  Semephores are on the way. Honest. ;-)

	- cleaned up code in tableai(). removed commenting I put there
	  a long time ago... I think the robot code is working fine ;-)

	- fixed delete bug in cdgetp().

	- removed/replaced all scopy() calls - uhg.

	- added HAS_SETITIMER to defs.h.  If defined, use set/getitimer 
	  routines instead of alarm().

	- created clog() function to be used to log msgs to the logfile.  
	  This used to be done by cerror(), which would also send a god 
	  msg if '@' was the first char in the message.  This was stupid. 
	  (although mine ;-).
	  cerror() was changed to ONLY send god messages, while clog() sends
 	  it's messages ONLY to the logfile.

	- added notimeout() curses call in another attempt to solve some
	  timing problems, and delays when reading the function keys.  It
	  seems to work, and has removed many unexplained 1 seconds delays 
	  when doing certain things.  And even with the timer disabled, 
	  function keys still seem to work, and without a 1 second delay 
	  after typing one.

	- removed sc*() and en*() dead functions...Yeah! 

	- Much clean up and removal of uneeded code.  

	- Fixed bug that would cause core dump if TERM not set properly.

	- Fixed bug introduced by me earlier causing some messages not to 
	  show up.

	- oppedit(): implemented editing of army, scan, and uninhabitable
	  time. These options were commented out in the original code.

	- removed/cleaned up transitional macros used early on by me 
	  during the VAX/VMS RatFor to Unix/C translation process.

	- initship() - fixed ulastentry indexing bug.

	- fmtminutes() - fixed formatting bug.

	- conqdriv:iterdrive() - fixed typo in array index.

	- Added signal handling capability.  Now Gods can INTR out nicely,
	  others can't.  Many small bug fixes.

	- conqdriv: added signal trapping capability so that KB interrupts 
	  are ignored, 	and conqdriv will die gracefully when getting a 
	  SIGTERM.

	- Added new function KPAngle() to return an angle depending on which
	  keypad key (or arrow key) was pressed.

	- rewote arrows() function. (This translates 'qweasdzc' keys
	  into directions (in degrees).  This funtion has NOTHING to do 
	  with your keyboard's arrow keys/keypad keys.)

	- fixed planet formatting bug.

	- another attempt at using the curses input routines. Changed
	  input routine return values to int's so can decode terminfo data on
	  keypad and arrow keys.  

	- Changed team effectiveness values back to their original settings.
	  I shouldn't have messed with mother nature.

	- fixed death certificate so that correct data is shown.

	- modp1() now handles negative numbers correctly.

	- histlist(), loghist(): fixed some bugs... no more trashing
	  of entries, and histlist() now lists hists correctly :-)

	- planlist(): fixed loop bug that output bogus info.

	- added ETA calculation ability to infoplanet() and infoship(). 
	  Enabled by defining DO_ETASTATS in defs.h.
	  This option may be added to the system wide conquest config 
	  file when that capability becomes available.

	- doinfo(): fixed bug that prevented 's<shipno>' from working.

	- Added Colors!  If your terminal/terminfo entry supports them
	  conquest will use them!  Much cooler.

	- fixed menu(): switchteams logic.

	- fixed dobeam(): up/down selection bug.

	- fixed rndini(): wrong seed init function being called - srand(), 
	  should have been srand48().

	- fixed rndint(): was returning (low, high], should have been 
	  (low, high).

	- Added PVLOCK/UNLOCK capability, fixed some minor bugs, changed cloak
	  code so that a cloaked, warp 0 ship is invisible to alert scanners.
	  Increase torp fuse to 50 seconds, thereby increasing range.  

	- Added	msync() to implement the upchuck() function.

	The following is the original conqnews file distributed with
the VAX/VMS DECUS distribution, circa 1985. 

	It is provided for historical reasons only and should not be
viewed as completely (or even remotely) accurate.  Hehe.

Enjoy!

---
08Sep85:  A completely  new  robot  strategy  has been installed!
          Watch out, because robots are smart now.

16Jun84:  You can now get a list of recent  users  with  the  'H'
          command.

13Jun84:  The new user stats page finally works!

11Jun84:  You can now get info on a user.

09Jun84:  Hacking  on temperature. Weapons and engines now have a
          chance of breaking when they get too hot.  Tuning  will
          continue for a little while.

27May84:  Bombing  and  beaming  have  been  modified so that the
          baud rate of your terminal doesn't have  such  a  large
          effect.

22Feb84:  Message  editing  implemented.  If you enter enter line
          feed as the target of a message, you  can  send  a  new
          message  by  editing  the target and text from the last
          message you sent (or attempted to send).

19Feb84:  You can now do info on "time".

11Feb84:  The driver bug that made bombing easy and ships  faster
          than  speeding  torps  has  been  fixed. Also, it is no
          longer possible for two terminals to control  the  same
          ship.  Now,  when  you reincarnate, you get to keep the
          same ship number.

15Jan84:  You can  now  switch  teams  as  long  as  you  haven't
          entered  any  ships  since  the last time you resigned.
          Weapons  defaulting  implemented;   firing   a   weapon
          without  specifying  a  direction  defaults to the last
          direction you fired any weapon.

14Jan84:  The tractor command has been split into  two  commands.
          Use  't'  to  tractor another ship and 'u' to untractor
          or attempt to  break  free  of  another  ships  tractor
          beams.  Also,  when  you attempt to tractor a ship, its
          velocity relative to your ship must be warp 2 or less.

          Shields now regenerate  twice  as  fast  (4  units  per
          second) when they are down.

09Jan84:  Robot  ships  now  automatically defend the home system
          from attack. Ship tuning continues.

20Dec83:  Massive ship tuning in progress...

10Dec83:  A new fuel usage formula has been  installed;  now  any
          activity  that uses fuel generates heat and adds to the
          temperature of the ship. Also, a bug which  caused  the
          autopilot  to overshoot planets has been discovered and
          fixed.

17Nov83:  Phaser base hits have been lowered from 100 to 92.

13Nov83:  New statistics are being kept (but currently, there  is
          no  way  to display them). Typing "i<cr>" will now give
          info on the last thing you ask for info on.

03Nov83:  A better acceleration formula has been installed.

23Oct83:  Tractor beams aren't quite so deadly anymore. (This  is
          a major   blow   to  Klingon  battle  tactics.)  A  new
          acceleration formula that is team  dependent  has  been
          added.  An  orbit  speed  limit has been imposed so now
          you cannot orbit if you are going faster than warp 2.

16Oct83:  Ships now enter at least accurate  info  distance  away
          from their nearest enemy.

15Oct83:  It  is  now  possible  to change war and peace settings
          from the menu.

06Oct83:  Shell spawning was removed. Spawn to DCL instead.

19Sep83:  The first Decus distribution  of  Conquest was  mailed
          today.

05Sep83:  Torpedo  detonation has been worked over so that all of
          your active torpedoes go off when you die;  this  means
          that  you  should always get credit for when your torps
          kill the ship that killed  you.  Spawning  to  DCL  was
          added,  use  '$'  followed  by  a  line feed to spawn a
          process.

01Sep83:  The race dependent weapons  factors  have  been  tuned,
          now  Orions are 0.83, Klingons and Federations are 1.0,
          and Romulans are 1.17.  The  course  command  has  been
          modified  so that when you set course for a planet, you
          get the same  information  as  you  do  with  the  info
          command.  Also,  when  you set course for another ship,
          if you terminate your command with line feed, you  will
          get info on the ship.

29Aug83:  The  Evil  Display  Bug took heavy damage yesterday and
          finally  fell  this  evening.  Services  will  be  held
          Wednesday at the Red Hour.

24Aug83:  The   phaser   command  modified  to  set  last  phaser
          direction even if your phasers are not ready  yet.  The
          planet list is now sorted by planet name.

13Aug83:  Torp  alert  code  added. Now you will always be warned
          when enemy torps get within accurate info range.

          Code added  to  (hopefully)  prevent  driver  thrashing
          when cpu time is at a premium.

          Cloaking  modified  to allow "silent running", i.e. you
          can stay cloaked at warp zero for a  long  time.  Also,
          cloaking  fuel  cost depends on speed (cloaking at warp
          10 is *very* expensive).

          Towing modified; the maximum  towing  distance  is  now
          larger.  Also, breaking free of an unfriendly ships tow
          does not always succeed and trying  freezes  your  ship
          up for a whole second.

12Aug83:  Weapon   tuning  continues.  Phasers  are  still  quite
          strong but this will be corrected in the  near  future.
          Now  distance  is  used  to  break  ties  when  you are
          searching for weak planets. This means that if you  ask
          for  info  on the weakest planet with 10 or more armies
          and two planets have 10 armies each, you will  be  told
          about  the  closer  of  the two. Also, the info command
          has been modified to warn you that a planet is  hostile
          when you get info on it.

17Jul83:  Several  bugs  related  to  the  conversion  to the new
          ratfor fixed. Ken's version of  phaser  graphics  added
          (complaints  to  him). Also, there is now a user option
          for phaser graphics.

04Jul83:  Conquest now runs from decnet ports!

03Jul83:  Planet  movement  is  three  times   smoother.   Novice
          players  will  now  enjoy  fantastic  phaser  graphics.
          Firing phasers no longer locks up your  ship,  but  you
          still  can't  fire  them more often than once a second.
          Torpedos are... different. (Ken was *not* amused.)  The
          remote terminal bug is almost fixed.

          On  its  one year anniversary, Conquest now runs on two
          Vaxen.

          Remember, this is Be Kind to Klingons  week,  so  don't
          aim for Ken's gonads.

14Jun83:  Full  duplex  screen  updating implemented. Now you can
          see  your   enemy   attacking   even   when   you   are
          constructing  an insult for him. Common block updating.
          Now the common block is flushed to  the  disk  every  5
          minutes.  This  should  take  care  of  the  time  warp
          problem.

23May83:  Captured system entry now works. The  evil  course  360
          wandering bug has been fixed.

13May83:  Even  more  driver  hacking,  now  the  "phase"  of the
          Universe is kept in the common block. This  means  that
          five  minute  things  will happen every five minutes of
          game  time,  etc.  You  can  now  send  mail  to   "The
          Implementors"  by  sending  a  message to "i". Finally,
          the self-destruct code was modified so that  it  really
          takes  fifteen  seconds to exit, even if some cretin is
          running rat4.

07May83:  Tuned driver  startup  logic.  Added  a  new  "nearest"
          thing  to  look  for,  nearest team planet, "ntp". This
          was done to appease  the  Conquest God,  who  was  not
          happy  with the hack to "nap". Also, all of the nearest
          planet special strings may now  be  qualified  with  an
          army  threshold.  A  new user option, "terse", has been
          added. For the most part, turning this option  shortens
          the  "press  space  for more" prompts. The manual entry
          has been revised; check it out for more information.

29Apr83:  A new and  improved  Conquest  manual  entry  has  been
          written  and  installed.  The  user  rating formula has
          been improved. When getting information on  or  setting
          course   for  the  nearest  army  planet,  "nap",  only
          planets that are owned by your team and have more  than
          three  armies are considered. Also, if you terminate an
          information command with LF instead  of  CR,  you  will
          get  info  about  the  second  nearest object. Code was
          added to automatically disable insert and  delete  line
          display.  (That's  right, you can throw away your local
          copy  of  termcap  without  getting  seasick!)  Inverse
          video  has been added to the pagefile routine. Finally,
          the Conquest operator program  is  even  MORE  powerful
          than before.

14Apr83:  New  command  implemented.  ^R now can be used to force
          the screen to be updated completely. Also, a  new  user
          option  forces  the  screen  to  always  be  completely
          updated, even during battle.

12Apr83:  Many, many more bugs fixed. Many more  features  added.
          Now  LF  can be used to send a message to the last ship
          you sent to. Driver hacking  is  now  complete;  it  is
          IMPOSSIBLE  for more than one driver to run at the same
          time. It is not possible to run a driver manually  from
          a terminal.  The  player  ships  now  notice  that  the
          driver has died within 5 seconds.  When  a  the  player
          who  has  the  driver  exits  Conquest,  he  causes the
          driver to kill itself; the other players then  bid  for
          running   it.   This   means   that  the  Game  is  not
          interrupted just because someone logs off.

19Mar83:  Many, many bugs fixed. Many  features  added.  Cloaking
          now   works.   Also,  enhanced  informational  scanning
          implemented.

08Dec82:  Re-organized  the  display  somewhat  to   enable   the
          terminal package to make use of clear-to-end-of-line.

04Nov82:  Implemented  some  restrictions  on playing: no playing
          over  dialups,  by  GUEST,   or   during   prime   time
          (7:00-18:00 weekdays). Priority is set to 2.

28Oct82:  Fixed bug in bombarding.

25Oct82:  Added n, ne, ns, np, nep, nr, nf, and na.

24Oct82:  Added  a  number  of new features, the biggest of which
          is  orbiting  planets.  Also  I  juggled  some  of  the
          parameters in an attempt to make the teams more equal.

18Oct82:  Added  a  "shit-list" flag, to prevent obnoxious people
          from playing. Added a real neat feature  which  finally
          lets  broadcast  messages  from  the  outside world get
          through. Made the game run at a lower priority.

13Oct82:  Changed the "p" command to not enter  a  mode.  Now  it
          just  fires  a  single  torp  and  goes back to command
          mode.

06Oct82:  Fixed a bug,  added  a  feature.  Recompiled  with  the
          re-written raw I/O library - should go faster now.

22Sep82:  Added  a  "last  words" feature - when you conquer, you
          get to leave a message for everyone to see.

20Sep82:  Minor tuning mods. Also the  doomsday  machine  is  now
          both less common and more sadistic.

13Sep82:  After  three  weeks  of  downtime,  I finally found the
          major  bug  in  the  slow-turning  code.  As  usual,  a
          strongly-typed  language  would  have  caught  it right
          away. I believe there are  still  some  minor  problems
          with   slow  turning  -  let  me  know  if  you  notice
          anything.

23Aug82:  Turning now takes time, and  it  takes  more  time  the
          faster you are going. Slow down to turn.

20Aug82:  Ken  the Kunning Klingon discovered an embarrassing bug
          - I had a test reversed in the  routine  takeplanet  so
          that  every  time  you  conquered  a  planet  you  also
          conquered the Universe.

18Aug82:  Fixed  annoyingly  persistent   bug   which   prevented
          planets from being taken.

08Aug82:  Couping  should  work  now.  Watch out for the doomsday
          machine.

29jul82:  I did some rewriting to  try  and  get  the  driver  to
          restart  automatically  when  it dies. It doesn't quite
          work yet, so beware...

27Jul82:  Arrow keys work. Locking onto planets works.

25Jul82:  The universe was conquered for the first time  tonight,
          by  the Orions. It almost worked perfectly. At the last
          instant, the common block  got  locked  up.  Also,  the
          Orion  team  didn't  get  credit for the win. Both bugs
          should be fixed now, so I am  looking  forward  to  the
          next conquest.

24Jul82:  Engine  temperature and fuel consumption are now pretty
          much working. I still have to  do  some  fiddling  with
          the constants to get things exactly right.

18Jul82:  Fixed  a  bug  which prevented anyone but Romulans from
          killing people. On second thought, maybe I should  have
          left it in...

16Jul82:  More    commands    added,    including   info.   Also,
          self-destruct now works even if  the  driver  is  dead.
          This should make Mister Xavier happy.

12Jul82:  You   can   now   change  course  and  fire  torpedoes.
          Commander Saavik immediately took advantage of this  by
          traveling   to   Earth   and   destroying   hoardes  of
          feddie-bears.

03Jul82:  The display works pretty well now. More commands  work.
          The  first  interplanetary  voyage  took  place  today:
          Commander  Saavik  piloted  the  Romulan  flagship   to
          Sirius.  The  ship was incinerated upon arrival. Saavik
          then journeyed to the edge of  the  galaxy,  where  she
          was one again incinerated. Score: galaxy 2, Saavik 0.

02Jul82:  The display started working today. Some commands work.

28Jun82:  Ships  are  flying now. However, the display generation
          and command interpretation still needs to be  done,  so
          it is not much use.

27Jun82:  The  news  option  was installed today. Ships should be
          flying pretty soon. The driver is working, I just  have
          to add the code to launch a ship.
