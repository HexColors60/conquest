- BUGS

  NONE :)

- improved configure support

  - detect when vital things are missing (bison, flex, glut.h, etc.)

  - add a BUILD REQUIREMENTS section somewhere - web page, README, build
    docs etc.  

- GENERAL

  - local ship movement computation?  Big/trickey job. would require
    protocol change.

    - how to handle/sync orbiting, tow, etc...

  - observer support?

  - new server flag? NoKillTeam - determines whether a ship can
    set war with it's own team.

  - support for more teams.  would have to go hand in hand with items
    below. 

  - split up common block

    - ship, user, game/admin common, planets, teams, etc.  Would
      require protocol changes.  Want to keep cqr's compatible as
      well.

      conversion to a new cmnblk format should be possible without
      losing existing data.

    - would allow more dynamic creation of games (for example adding a
      new team, increasing the number of ships, planets, etc).

    - allow definiton of new ship types/capabilities/limits?  

  - run a telnet server that takes you directly to a meta list?  That
    would be cool - run a 'proxy' for telnet players allowing them to
    connect to any registered server rather than just the main server
    at conquest.radscan.com... 

  - provide 'game config' dir containing config files that specify
    things like number of ships allowed, planet definitions (for custom
    universes, etc) for a particular game.

  - provide seperate 'game data dir' like above containing common blocks,
    log locations, etc so a single binary installation could handle
    multiple games (rather than compiling a conquest for each game
    with a different --prefix= ).

    - perhaps game data location, etc defined in conquestrc file that
      can be specified on the conquest/conqoper/conquestd cmd line?

  - enable/disable client recording from within the game

  - allow user to go to the meta list from within the game (without
    restarting with the -m flag).

    - maybe if conquest was run with '-m', then when the users quits
      from the main menu, you go back to the meta list?  

  - add more EXEC commands for operators to send to GOD - kill a ship(s),
    create robot(s), etc...

- IP restrictions?

  - how to handle telnet servers?

  - would need new 'client driver' common block, NUMSHIPS structures
    with IP, PID, interclient-event broadcast flags, etc.

  - IP config file, listing IP's and their limits

  - default server restriction of two ships (conquestrc configurable)
    per IP.

    - consider enabling/re-implementing the multiple ships per user stuff?


- OpenGL

  - add more 'animated activity' like the new explosion and NEB
    rendering in 8.1a+. Generalize to generic per-node animation lists
    using a new 'animation engine'.

  - individual textures for each planet

  - more flexible color specification for suns, etc rather than being
    limited to primary colors like red, blue, green, yellow etc.

  - texture-mapped HUD?

  - asynchronous server connection handling, so client isn't 'stuck'
    while establishing a connection to a server.

  - better UDP negotiation.  Option to enable/disable from within the
    game. 

  - SDL backend?

  - have doomsday 'beam' rendered when it's attacking it's target.

    - have server send an attacking flag, and client is responsible
      for drawing it.

- PROTOCOL

  - add pads to those structures not having them?

  - for packets with strings, standardize string len (align 32b) -
    same for meta proto?  increase MOTD, etc...?

  - versioning improvment... use major == incompat, minor == compat...

  - revamp so there is eough info provided to the client to create the
    common block(s) from scratch, rather than relying on compiled-in
    definitions, sizes, names, etc.

- Blue Sky

  - sound?  SDL?

  - different game types:

    - classic (like it is now)

    - deathmatch - free for all, or team.  

    - Capture The Planet :)

  - wormholes, moving, stationary, uni or bidirectional?  

  - 'Fast' flag... speeding up the game?  Faster regen/cooldown, bombing,
    beaming, speed, firing, etc?
